# About the Dr. Nut Website
This project is an official website for a soft drink band, Dr. Nut. The website have Home, About, History, Products, and Blog pages. A well-reorganized brand goes back to live with new promotion. 

In order to enhance UI/UX experience of this website with audiences, we added some animation effects and functions through CSS and Javascript that can interact with audiences. For example, each page has something interesting going on for end users to click and show extra information and enrich the page's presentation. The top banner in the index page allows audiences to see three more product pictures by clicking and pictures will be sliding in from the right. In addition, we added 3 hot spots on the product page, so that audiences could read the product information in 3 pop-up boxes by clicking those 3 buttons. Finally, the blog page will showcase gallery of products for marketing promotion and event by CSS transition.
